# rTechManager - Troubleshooting

1. THE "REAL" ERROR MESSAGE
# If systemctl start fails, the reason is here:
sudo journalctl -u rtechmanager -e

2. DIST FOLDER MISSING
# If the website shows a white screen or 404:
cd /opt/rtechmanager
npm run build
# Ensure a 'dist' folder now exists with index.html inside.

3. VNC PASSWORD PROMPT
# If VNC fails to start in background, it's usually waiting for a password.
# Run this as root:
sudo vncpasswd

4. NODE VERSION MISMATCH
# If you see "Unsupported engine" or "Module did not self-register":
node -v 
# If not v22, follow Step 1 in setup.txt.
# Then run: rm -rf node_modules && npm install

5. KILLING ZOMBIE PROCESSES
# If port 1783 is already in use:
sudo fuser -k 1783/tcp
sudo systemctl restart rtechmanager
